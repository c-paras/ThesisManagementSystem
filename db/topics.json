If it is not possible to tell them apart, the computer could be deamed to be intelligent. Turing predicted that in about 50 years, it would be possible to devise a computer system that would fool the interrogator. So far, Turing's prediction has not been fulfilled. However, even simple conversational agents have their uses. Speech activated systems, like Apple's Siri and Google Now, are becoming more widespread. This project aims to build a conversational agent that uses online knowledge, so as found in Wikipedia and other sources, to be able to converse intelligently with a user.",

This may have direct effects, such as eliminating a key regulatory interaction, or more subtle indirect effects by altering/blocking neighbouring interactions.

A matching is stable if there is no resident and hospital that are unmatched, but would prefer each other over their current match, and there is no couple of residents (r1, r2) and pair of hospitals (h1, h2) such that r1 is not matched to h1 or r2 is not matched to h2 but all of (r1, r2), h1, h2 weakly prefer that r1 is matched to h1 and r2 is matched to h2.

A select-discard branching rule chooses a vertex v, and considers two subproblems, one where v is added to the independent set that is being computed and one where it is not added. Modern analyses of such branching algorithms take into account how the instance changes in these recursive calls - besides that the number of vertices decreases, some vertices also have their degrees decreased, and all of this information is used to upper bound the number of times the algorithm makes a recursive call. Another branching rule might go over all possibilities to add one vertex from N[v] (the set containing v and its neighbors) to the independent set. Which rule is better depends on the structure of the graph around the vertex v, and for some some such structures it might be more advantageous to choose a neighbor of v to branch on, instead of v.",

It is a stressful time for everyone. ikki is a reassuring buddy for the sick child, helps manage their clinical care, and is their constant companion who always has their back in troubling times. ikki also helps relieve the child?s parents of some of their burden. ikki also reports data to the clinical team who can update its care program in response to the child?s condition. ikki is designed to be manufactured at a price point that enables the hospital to provide each sick child with their own ikki, for life. Whilst we are working with sick children in the first instance, we have a full pipeline of other potential applications for ikki.

The application is expected to identify patterns in the way pdf or word documents are edited, and smoothly and non-intrusively interact with users to let them confirm or introduce exceptions to editing rules that can be as simple as italicising text, to more complex changes such as reformulating phrases.
